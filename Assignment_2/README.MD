# CSCI611 — Assignment_2 (CNN on CIFAR-10 + Feature Map Visualizations)

This folder contains my complete submission for CSCI611 Assignment 2:
- Task 1: CNN design + training on CIFAR-10 (PyTorch)
- Task 2A: Conv1 feature map visualization
- Task 2B: Maximally activating images for selected Conv2 filters

## Contents

- `build_cnn.ipynb`  
  Main Jupyter/Colab notebook containing:
  - dataset setup + transforms (train/val/test)
  - CNN definition and training loop
  - checkpointing by best validation loss
  - evaluation (overall + per-class accuracy)
  - Task 2A feature map visualizations (Conv1)
  - Task 2B top-5 maximally activating images (Conv2 filters)
  - all execution traces / outputs

- `Report.pdf`  
  Final PDF report submitted to Canvas.

## How to Run (Recommended: Google Colab)

1. Open `build_cnn.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Runtime → Change runtime type → set **Hardware accelerator = GPU**.
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.

The notebook will:
- train the CNN,
- save the best checkpoint based on validation loss,
- print test accuracy (overall + per-class),
- generate and save all required plots/images listed above.

## How to Run Locally (Optional)

### Option A: Using pip + venv
1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:
   - Install PyTorch (CPU or CUDA build depending on your system)
   - Install the remaining packages used in the notebook

Then open and run the notebook:
- `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`
- run `build_cnn.ipynb`



## Notes on Outputs / Execution Traces

This submission uses a Jupyter/Colab notebook. All execution traces (training logs, evaluation output, and visualization generation) are contained inside `build_cnn.ipynb`, so no additional screenshots are required.

## Dataset

The notebook uses `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10` and downloads the dataset automatically when run.
